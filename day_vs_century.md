# A Day in Heaven, A Century on Earth
*Why scalable AI must also be sustainable AI — and why code that ignores the machine is no longer acceptable.*

---

We’re living through an age of paradox.

Never before has it been easier to write code. 
Never before has it been harder to write good code.

AI can now generate complete programs, functional modules, even entire systems. It can produce logic that compiles, runs, and sometimes even passes tests. This shift has sparked a powerful belief: that human programmers are on their way out, and that scale, of models, data, and compute, is all that matters.

But here’s the problem: most of this AI-generated code is catastrophically inefficient.

It may be correct. It may look clean. But it does not respect the machine.

And if we continue building AI atop code that bloats memory, burns cycles, and treats hardware abstraction as a crutch rather than a tool, then we are building a future that may scale, but it will not sustain.

## The Rising Cost of Indifference
Every time we run an AI model, we consume energy. Every inference call, every rollout, every self-play match, is a small transaction in a vast global computation economy. The cost may be hidden from view—measured in milliseconds, not dollars—but it adds up.

And yet, the vast majority of AI infrastructure today is built on top of scripting languages, dynamic runtimes, deep abstraction stacks, and increasingly, code generated by other AI, code that is unconcerned with CPU pipelines, cache behavior, or energy usage.

This is not a flaw of intelligence. It is a failure of alignment.

Because if we claim to be building intelligent systems, they should also be intelligently engineered.

AI that scales but doesn’t respect compute is not progress. It’s **debt**.

## Reclaiming the Discipline
In 2018, John Hennessy and David Patterson—architects of the RISC revolution and authors of Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach—stood on stage to accept the Turing Award. But instead of celebrating the past, they issued a warning for the future.

*“Modern scripting languages… give lots of power, but they run terribly. They are incredibly inefficient.”*

They saw what was coming: a world where performance is assumed, and efficiency is forgotten. A world where the machine is no longer a partner in the design loop, but an afterthought—left to sort out the overhead we’re too lazy or too abstracted to manage.

But machines do not forget. The cost of inefficiency is always paid. In cycles. In latency. In energy.

## PCA³: A Framework for Responsible Code
This chapter—and this post—is my response to that warning. I call it PCA³:
Performance-Conscious, Architecture-Aware, AI-Aligned programming.

It’s not a coding style. It’s a philosophy:

- Performance-Conscious: Every cycle is a cost. We measure, prune, and think in throughput.
- Architecture-Aware: We write code that maps cleanly onto the machine—registers, cache lines, instruction-level parallelism.
- AI-Aligned: We build systems that are not just smart, but structured to scale responsibly.

And the truth is: this mindset is not just for C programmers or embedded engineers. It’s for anyone who writes AI. Because if we allow inefficiency to be the foundation, every layer above it inherits that flaw.

## A Simple Challenge: Simulate 100 Million Games
To put this philosophy into practice, I chose a deceptively simple task:
simulate 100 million random games of Connect 4.

In the emerging Era of Experience, simulation isn't just a technique, it’s the lifeblood of learning. Each simulated game is an experience: an interaction, an outcome, a consequence. And from experience, intelligence emerges.

The backbone of search-based intelligence.
Simulated rollouts form the core of algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), powering breakthroughs such as AlphaGo, MuZero, and countless strategic game-playing agents. These simulations are not guesses, they are virtual futures, mapped before a move is made.

The engine of learning in reinforcement systems.
Every simulated transition, every action, reward, and resulting state, becomes a piece of training data. Simulations generate the experience needed to shape value functions, train policy networks, and sculpt behavior that improves over time. No experience, no learning.

A real-world workload in modern AI.
Whether developing agents that explore unknown environments, optimize long-term strategies, or learn entirely from self-play, the system must simulate millions of interactions. Fast. Repeatedly. And often under strict computational limits. Simulation isn’t just a tool, it’s the infrastructure of experience-based intelligence, from virtual board games to embodied robotics.  

In other words, this isn’t just an experiment. It’s the computational core of intelligent systems.

I started from a Python baseline that reflects exactly what you’d get today if you asked a state-of-the-art generative AI to “write a Connect 4 simulator.” It was object-oriented. It was readable. It was idiomatic.

But it took 703 seconds to simulate 1 million games. This basically rules out any serious intelligence if we want the robot/agent to make decisions in real time. 

>Extrapolated: nearly a full day to perform 100 million simulation, or 1422 simulation per second, or 14.22 per millisecond. 

So I rebuilt it from the ground up, following PCA³ principles, step by step, version by version, optimization after optimization, aligning it ever more closely with the way modern CPUs think. 

And the results speak for themselves.

## The Result: From Earth to Heaven
Scaling the simulation from 1 million to 100 million, python version would need more than 70,279 seconds, while our last c version would need only 1.9 seconds, 36873x faster, on the same hardware, a MacBook Air M1 notebook.

In other words, a day running PCA³-supercharged C version would be equivalent to more than a century of runtime using those AI-generate, "human-replacing", programs.

On a relatively aged consumer desktop CPU, AMD 3950x, 16 cores and 32 threads, the difference is even greater:

| chapter14_sim_v7.c |    **0.592 sec**  | **~136,069x** |

That is 136,069x difference, or 372 years vs 1 day. 

You'd better start your AI-generated Python program around the time New York City was incorporated in 1653, so it can finish its simulation tomorrow, right alongside the PCA³ C version you started today. 

## Beyond Speed: Toward Sustainability
It is our responsibility not just to optimize, but to lead. To guide both ourselves and our AI collaborators toward code that respects the machine, and the planet.

Because in the end, efficiency is not just an engineering concern. It is a question of sustainability, of how much computation the Earth can carry, and how wisely we choose to use it.

This is how we code with clarity, with purpose, and with conscience. It’s how we build systems that are not just intelligent, but responsible. And it’s how we ensure that the future of AI is not just powerful, but sustainable, aligned, and worthy of the intelligence it seeks to serve.

> A day in heaven. A century on earth.

That’s what modern compute can do, if we learn to write code that’s worthy of it.
