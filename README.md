# ðŸ§  AI Forge â€“ Binary Releases

This repository hosts precompiled binaries from *The AI Forge* by Jianxian Wu, optimized for benchmarking and experimentation.

Each binary corresponds to a specific version or technique covered in Chapter 14 of the book. You can download and run them individually to experience the performance difference between naÃ¯ve Python-like code and fully optimized PCAÂ³-style C implementations.

## ðŸ“¥ Download Binaries

Binaries are available for two platforms:

- ðŸ–¥ macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon): `*_macos_arm64`
- ðŸ’» Linux x86_64 (AMD64): `*_linux_amd64`

## ðŸš€ How to Run a Python version

```bash
python3 chapter14_sim.py 1000000
```
This will run python version for 1000000 games.

## ðŸš€ How to Run a Binary

1. **Download** a binary matching your system, e.g.:

```bash
   wget https://github.com/pca3press/ai_forge_binaries/releases/download/CH14-v1.0/chapter14_sim_v7_macos_arm64
   ```
2. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x chapter14_sim_v7_macos_arm64
```

3. Run it with a number of simulated games:

```bash
./chapter14_sim_v7_macos_arm64 1000000
```

You can repeat this with other versions (e.g., v0, v1, v7, ilp, bbl) to compare performance.

 
## Batch Execution Script
Download and run the included batch script:
```bash
chmod +x chapter14_run.sh
./chapter14_run.sh 1000000
```

Inside the script, choose your platform by setting one of these lines at the top:

```bash
ARCH="macos_arm64"
# ARCH="linux_amd64"
```
The script will automatically run all available simulation versions for that platform.

ðŸ§ª SHA-256 Verification
Each file's SHA-256 hash is shown in the release. You can verify manually:

```bash
shasum -a 256 chapter14_sim_v7_macos_arm64
```
